# Stress-Testing-Bash-Script


## What is Stress - Testing ?
It's process of checking your solution against a correct/brute-force solution to verify the correctness of your approach on random test cases.

The script will generate random test cases using the generator file and then compare both the final approach and brute forced approach. 
If your solution fails it'll show WA and give the test case on which it fails.
